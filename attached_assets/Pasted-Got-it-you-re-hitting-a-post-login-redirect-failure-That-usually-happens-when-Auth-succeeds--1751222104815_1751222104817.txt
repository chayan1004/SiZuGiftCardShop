Got it — you're hitting a post-login redirect failure. That usually happens when:

✅ Auth succeeds, but

❌ Redirect is either:

Pointing to / instead of /merchant-dashboard

Or the ProtectedRoute isn’t detecting the new login token properly

Or the AuthContext isn’t persisting the merchant role or token after sign-up

🧠 Here's how to debug and fix it step by step:
✅ Step 1: Check Login API Response
Open client/src/pages/MerchantLogin.tsx and confirm this:

ts
Copy
Edit
const response = await fetch("/api/merchant/login", ...);
const data = await response.json();
✅ Check if the response includes the merchant role, or at minimum a token.

You should have:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "token": "jwt-token-here",
  "role": "merchant"
}
✅ Step 2: Check AuthContext After Login
Go to client/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx and confirm the login handler saves the token and merchant role:

ts
Copy
Edit
localStorage.setItem("token", data.token);
setUser({ ...decodedToken, role: "merchant" });
If setUser() isn't triggered or doesn't store the role, the ProtectedRoute may not let them through.

✅ Step 3: Check the ProtectedRoute Redirect Logic
Go to client/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx and verify:

ts
Copy
Edit
if (!user || user.role !== "merchant") {
  return <Navigate to="/merchant-login" />;
}
If this condition fails, you’ll keep bouncing around.

Also check if it mistakenly does this on login:

ts
Copy
Edit
navigate("/");
❌ If it does, that’s the bug. It should redirect to:

ts
Copy
Edit
navigate("/merchant-dashboard");
✅ Step 4: Fix the Redirect in MerchantSignup.tsx
Find the code in client/src/pages/MerchantSignup.tsx that runs after signup:

ts
Copy
Edit
const response = await fetch("/api/merchant/register", ...);
const data = await response.json();
navigate("/");
❌ navigate("/") is WRONG.

✅ Replace with:

ts
Copy
Edit
navigate("/merchant-dashboard");
✅ Step 5: Re-Verify with Console Logs
After signup and login, check your browser dev tools:

localStorage → must have a valid token

AuthContext → user must have role = "merchant"

Network tab → /api/merchant/login must return 200 + token

✅ Bonus Fix (If Needed): Add Guard in /merchant-dashboard
Inside MerchantDashboard.tsx:

ts
Copy
Edit
const { user } = useAuth();

if (!user || user.role !== "merchant") {
  return <Navigate to="/merchant-login" />;
}
Make sure this check exists, and the dashboard doesn’t crash when loaded fresh.

Let Me Know
Once you fix the redirect path and confirm the context is set properly, you’ll land on the dashboard as expected.
