_Last Updated: 2025-06-30 14:55:59_

---

## ✅ OVERALL SYSTEM STATUS

**Platform:** ✅ Feature-complete  
**Workflow Health:** ⚠️ 95% stable — only a few critical bugs  
**Production Readiness:** 🚀 With small fixes and secure secrets, ready for launch  
**Security:** 🔐 Strong base, but hardcoded tokens and fallback auth must be removed  
**Code Quality:** 🧱 Solid architecture, just needs cleanup & refactors in large files  

---

## 🔐 AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY

- ✅ JWT-based auth, email verification
- ❌ Critical: Insecure token fallback (`merchant-<id>`), hardcoded admin/JWT secrets
- 🔧 Replit Fix Prompt:
```ts
Remove the legacy fallback logic in `requireMerchant` that allows any token starting with 'merchant-'. Enforce only verified JWTs and secure the default admin token using `process.env.ADMIN_TOKEN`.
```

---

## 💳 PAYMENT & SQUARE GIFT CARD INTEGRATION

- ✅ Square SDK + gift card issuance flow
- ❌ No rollback if payment succeeds but card fails
- 🔧 Replit Fix Prompt:
```ts
In `/api/public/checkout`, implement rollback logic: if `squareGiftCardService.createGiftCard()` fails, initiate a refund using `squarePaymentService.refund()`. Add Square idempotency keys.
```

---

## 🎁 GIFT CARD REDEMPTION

- ❌ Bug: `redeemGiftCard()` uses `card.id` instead of `card.gan`
- 🔧 Replit Fix Prompt:
```ts
In `routes.ts`, replace `redeemGiftCard(card.id)` with `redeemGiftCard(card.gan)` so DB record is correctly marked redeemed.
```

---

## 📬 EMAIL DELIVERY

- ❌ Only SMTP path is used
- 🔧 Replit Fix Prompt:
```ts
Update `emailService.sendGiftCardEmail()` to first try `EmailServiceBackup.sendUsingMailgunAPI()`, then fallback to SMTP if API call fails.
```

---

## 🧾 PDF RECEIPTS

- ✅ Fully functional
- 🔧 Replit Fix Prompt:
```ts
Protect `/receipts` folder from public access by adding Express middleware to validate UUID tokens for download, or use signed links.
```

---

## 📊 DASHBOARDS

- ✅ Clean, scoped dashboards
- 🔧 Replit Fix Prompt:
```ts
Split `routes.ts` into `routes/auth.ts`, `routes/orders.ts`, `routes/webhooks.ts`, and import them in main app for maintainability.
```

---

## 📡 WEBHOOK SYSTEM

- ❌ Hardcoded webhook secrets
- 🔧 Replit Fix Prompt:
```ts
Ensure `process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY` is used everywhere, and delete fallback default `'sizu-webhook-secret-2025'`.
```

---

## 🛡️ FRAUD DETECTION

- ❌ In-memory state only
- 🔧 Replit Fix Prompt:
```ts
Refactor `FraudDetectionService` to use Redis (or a file-based fallback) for rate-limiting counters, so detection logic survives restarts.
```

---

## 📱 QR SCANNER

- ✅ Mobile-optimized and secure
- 🔧 Replit Fix Prompt:
```ts
Add a fallback input field for manual GAN entry in `/merchant-qr-scanner.tsx` if QR scan fails or camera not available.
```

---

## 📈 ANALYTICS

- 🔧 Replit Fix Prompt:
```ts
In `AnalyticsService.ts`, replace in-memory aggregations with SQL aggregate functions (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `GROUP BY`) to boost performance.
```

---

## 🔑 API KEY MANAGEMENT

- ✅ Secure key hashing + display once
- 🔧 Replit Fix Prompt:
```ts
Add `lastUsedAt` and `usageCount` tracking in `apiKeyMiddleware`, and support automatic expiration after 90 days of inactivity.
```

---

## 🧱 GENERAL MAINTENANCE

- 🔧 Replit Fix Prompt:
```ts
Delete `routes-simple.ts`, `mockPaymentService.ts`, and unused UI components from `client/src/pages`. Disable `X-Powered-By` and use Helmet.
```
