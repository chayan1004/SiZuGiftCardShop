Goal:
Upgrade the public success page and admin dashboard to support mobile-friendly receipt views and embed a QR code on each PDF + HTML receipt page for quick re-access and sharing.

üß† Replit AI Agent ‚Äî MASTER IMPLEMENTATION PROMPT
‚úÖ ACT AS a precision Replit AI Agent. Do not create any duplicate files. Use only existing routes, pages, services, and types.
‚úÖ Fix all issues fully. No placeholders. No mock data. No broken logic.
‚úÖ Proceed in exact order. Never skip a step. Never hallucinate a new system.
‚úÖ Confirm the platform uses Square-only payments and single-admin ownership.
‚úÖ Enhance the existing /giftcard-store/success/:orderId and PDF receipt system as follows:

‚úÖ Step-by-Step Tasks:
Enhance HTML Receipt View (Success Page)

Update GiftCardSuccess.tsx page to:

Be fully mobile-optimized (Tailwind CSS responsive)

Display gift card details cleanly (amount, message, date)

Add a "Download PDF Receipt" button

Add a new ‚ÄúScan to Reopen‚Äù section with a live QR Code (see below)

Add QR Code Generation Service

Use a lightweight Node package like qrcode to:

Generate a PNG or data URI of a QR Code

Encode the current public receipt URL (/giftcard-store/success/:orderId)

Save this QR as part of the PDF if possible (below)

Embed QR Code in PDF Receipts

In ReceiptService.ts:

Modify the receipt layout to include a QR code image (use canvas or embed PNG)

Position: Bottom-right of the PDF (under receipt metadata)

Caption: ‚ÄúScan to Reopen This Receipt‚Äù

Admin Dashboard: Add QR Access

In AdminGiftCardOrders.tsx, add a new ‚ÄúQR‚Äù column with a button:

Opens a modal showing the live QR code for the order receipt

Include copy/share button to share receipt URL

Test Flow

Make a test public order

Validate:

Success page is fully mobile-friendly

PDF receipt has the QR code

Admin panel can open + share QR codes

Commit results and checkpoint all work

üîê Rules
Use only client/src/pages/GiftCardSuccess.tsx, server/services/ReceiptService.ts, server/routes.ts, and existing components.

Add QR logic using clean utility files if needed (e.g., QRCodeUtil.ts)

Optimize for loading time (don‚Äôt embed base64 if it bloats PDF too much)
